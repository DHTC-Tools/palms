PALMS
=====

Programs, Applications and Libraries Management and Setup

PALMS (Programs, Applications and Libraries Management and Setup)
 is a system to install and manage software in a CVMFS repository such as OASIS. It simplifies 
 the packaging and installation of a software in different versions for different platforms and 
 it helps users to setup the correct and desired environment (applications and libraries).   
 With OASIS and PALMS, OSG can therefore offer not only a central location to install and store 
 software, but also tools and procedures for VO librarians (software managers) to install and 
 maintain the software. And once the software is distributed, PALMS will help VO users access 
 the software.  By using PALMS the VOs will follow best practices and common guidelines set by 
 OSG and enforced by PALMS.
